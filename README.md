# TachiyomiImageSplitter

Sometimes when trying images on old tablet some images are too big.
(Especially when reading webtoons) so I made this app that will look inside tachiyomi folder and
will split images based on screen size.

It will only work if you downloaded chapters.

Path should be set in you home `Tachiyomi` folder.
